Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic dataset⚓

📁 Project Description

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival patterns, and relationships between key features. The goal is to draw meaningful insights using data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

📌 Dataset Details

Dataset: Titanic (from Kaggle / public repository)

Columns Used: Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Embarked, etc.

✅ Tasks Performed

📥 Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas

🧹 Handled missing data in Age, Embarked, and dropped Cabin

📊 Analyzed survival distribution based on:

•Gender
•Passenger Class
•Age
•Embarkation Port


🎨 Created visualizations using Seaborn & Matplotlib:

•Survival by Gender
•Age distribution by Survival
•Stacked bar chart of Survival by Class and Gender

📷 Visualizations Sample

•Survival by Gender
•Age Distribution by Survival
•Survival by Class & Gender(Stacked Bar)

💻 Tools Used

•Python
•Pandas	
•Seaborn	
•Matplotlib	
•Google Colab	

📈 Key Insights

•Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
•1st class passengers were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.
•Younger children (age < 10) had a better chance of survival.
•Missing data in Age was handled using the median, and Cabin was dropped due to high null values.
